🎬 Movie Genre Classification using NLP & Deep Learning

🎯 Overview
Ever wondered how streaming platforms categorize movies into different genres? This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning to automatically predict movie genres based on plot descriptions. By analyzing textual patterns, the model learns to classify movies into the right genres, making it useful for recommendation systems, content filtering, and metadata tagging.

🚀 Technologies & Tools
🔹 Programming Language: Python
🔹 Libraries & Frameworks:

Data Handling: pandas, numpy
Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
NLP Processing: nltk (Stopwords Removal, Lemmatization), Tokenization, pad_sequences
Machine Learning: scikit-learn (train-test split, evaluation metrics)
Deep Learning: TensorFlow, Keras
🔍 Approach & Methodology
1️⃣ Data Preprocessing

Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset (movie_data.csv) by removing noise, stopwords, and applying lemmatization.
Converted text into numerical format using Tokenization & Padding.
2️⃣ Model Architecture

Built a Sequential Deep Learning Model with:
✅ Embedding Layer for text vectorization
✅ Dense Layers with activation functions for classification
✅ Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss for multi-class genre prediction
3️⃣ Training & Evaluation

Split data into training & testing sets.
Optimized the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
📊 Results
🎥 The model demonstrated high accuracy in genre classification!
📌 The confusion matrix and evaluation metrics show strong predictive performance.

🔮 Future Enhancements & Real-World Applications
🔸 Smarter Recommendations – Enhance movie recommendation engines by suggesting content based on predicted genres.
🔸 Automated Content Tagging – Automate genre classification for filmmakers, streaming services, and archives.
🔸 AI-Powered Metadata Generation – Help media companies tag content dynamically.
🔸 Deployment as an API – Integrate the model into websites and apps for instant genre classification.
